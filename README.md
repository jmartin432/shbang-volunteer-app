# Sh'Bang Volunteer App

## Description
A bare-bones web app created by me while working as 
Volunteer Coordinator for the Sh'Bang Festival.

Volunteers use the app to see their schedule for
the weekend and general team information.

Volunteer managers ('Buckstops') are able to see 
their team schedule, team contact info and post reviews
to about volunteer performance.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* JacaScript
* CSS
* AWS Amplify
* AWS Lambda
* AWS API Gateway
* Airtable API
